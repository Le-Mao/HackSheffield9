# Welcome to our epic hack
We created an environment simulator that shows how the populations of certain organisms affect an environment. 
We used three different levels of the food chain to represent this: 
1. Producer 
2. Herbivore
3. Carnivore 

#### Food chain we have used (made up)
Plant <- Moose <- Wolf 
Human eats Moose, Wolf and Plant 

## Replication on your computer 
If using VS code replicate this you need to: 
(Please use vs code, couldnt get this to work in pycharm) - will be similar process in command line
1. Create a Venv with python 
2. `pip install` multiple packages 
    a. streamlit
    b. matplotlib
    c. any others when prompted 
3. Enter into the HackSheffield9 project folder in a terminal and run `streamlit run .\Home.py` 
    a.  A page should pop up and you can access everything from there


When shutting the page down, `^C` in the terminal **before** closing the webpage
